Getting Started
===============

Mandriva control center export the following d-bus interfaces to interact with
the system wide configurations:

    * org.mandrivalinux.org.mcc2.users
    * org.mandrivalinux.org.mcc2.services

Installing software
===================

From source code:

    python setup.py install

Users and Groups
================

Let's learn by example.

Here's a quick examples, how to use org.mandrivalinux.org.mcc2.users d-bus
interfaces::

    # Connecting to the Bus
    >>> import dbus
    >>> bus = dbus.SystemBus()

    # Proxy object
    >>> proxy = bus.get_object(
    ...     'org.mandrivalinux.mcc2.Users',
    ...     '/org/mandrivalinux/mcc2/Users')

    # 
    >>> interface = dbus.Interface(proxy, 'org.mandrivalinux.mcc2.Users')
    >>> for user in interface.Users():
    ...     print user
    







System Services

.. admonition:: Mac OS X permissions

   If you're using Mac OS X, you may see the message "permission denied" when
   you try to run ``django-admin.py startproject``. This is because, on
   Unix-based systems like OS X, a file must be marked as "executable" before it
   can be run as a program. To do this, open Terminal.app and navigate (using
   the ``cd`` command) to the directory where :doc:`django-admin.py
   </ref/django-admin>` is installed, then run the command
   ``chmod +x django-admin.py``.

.. note::

    You'll need to avoid naming projects after built-in Python or Django
    components. In particular, this means you should avoid using names like
    ``django`` (which will conflict with Django itself) or ``test`` (which
    conflicts with a built-in Python package).
