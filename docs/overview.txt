This section provides a brief overview. Without going too much into detail,
it outlines the most important aspects of the :term:`MCC2` architecture.

Design philosophies
===================

The main design is to split :term:`MCC2` basicaly in user interface
and :term:`Bus` interfaces methods.

Frontend
--------
This part will be build using `QT4`_ more exacly `Qt Quick`_ using
`PySide`_ bindings.

Backend
-------
The implementation of this part will be in top of `D-Bus`_ and `PolicyKit`_.
